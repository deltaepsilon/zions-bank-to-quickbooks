zions-bank-to-quickbooks
========================

Zions Bank will only let me download crappy little CSV files. Quickbooks wants nicely formatted IIF files. This little guy does the translation.

Run like so ```node zions.js download.csv``` and watch the output in ```result.iif```.
I haven't spent any time making this prettier than it has to be. I intend to run this sucker once a month, copy the result.iif file out to another part of the filesystem, and forget about it for another month.
